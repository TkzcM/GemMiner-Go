# Provably Rare Gem Miner Go (for Rarity)

### Pull Request is strongly welcome as I don't know anything about Golang/Python/Web3.

# Usage
- 0. Install Python 3.x if you don't have it.
- 1. Get Visual Studio Build Tools from [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools&rel=16](here).
- 2. Install it with "C++ Desktop Development" marked and restart your PC.
- 3. Win+R, input "cmd", click Run, input "pip install web3" and hit "Enter".
- 4. Unzip the zip file from [https://github.com/TkzcM/GemMiner-Go/releases](Releases).
- 5. Edit raritygems.py, fill your address, private key and gems kind in it.
- 6. Double click loop.py and mining started (There's no output).

- Ex. If you want to random the salt, just open raritygems.py and replace "./main.exe" to "./main-rand.exe".
